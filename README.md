# SolarSurfer

Robotic solar powered surfboard propelled by the BlueRobotics T100 Thruster.

## Overview

The SolarSurfer is robotic surfboard propelled by two T100s. It will be launched from the coast of California on a 2,500 mile journey to Hawaii. It will complete the three-month trip completely autonomously.

Cause why not.

## Software

The complete SolarSurfer software system has many parts. These include:

* [SolarSurferMessage](https://github.com/bluerobotics/SolarSurferMessage) - a custom message format and encoding/decoding library for JavaScript and C++
* [SolarSurferCore](https://github.com/bluerobotics/SolarSurferCore) - the embedded software running on the SolarSurfer; requires SolarSurferMessage
* [SolarSurferAPI](https://github.com/bluerobotics/SolarSurferAPI) - an API that sends, receives, and stores SolarSurfer messages; requires SolarSurferMessage for automated encoding and decoding
* [SolarSurferCommander](https://github.com/bluerobotics/SolarSurferCommander) - a private app to review telemetry and build command messages
* [SolarSurferInfographic](https://github.com/bluerobotics/SolarSurferInfographic) - a public app to view telemetry in an engaging format
